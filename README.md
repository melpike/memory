# Overview

Created a memory game to practice Typescriptâ€”originally created using jsx components, but has now been refactored.

This is a basic memory game to see if two cards match. If not a match, they flip back over. If they are a match, they remained flipped up.

# Features

- Reset button to restart the game
- A guess counter to track your moves
- Custom illustrations created in Illustrator
- Flip animation on cards

# Future

- Create a "High Scores" section to show the top 3 scores based off the counter.
